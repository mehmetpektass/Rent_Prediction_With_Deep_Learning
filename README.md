# Real Estate Price Prediction & Data Processing Pipelineüè†

## Description
This project is a comprehensive real estate data processing and prediction pipeline. It includes web-scraped data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict house prices and classify properties into price ranges.

## Features

* **Web-Scraped Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
    * Removes unnecessary columns.
    * Extracts and standardizes categorical and numerical        features.
    * Converts Turkish floor naming conventions into numeric values.
    * Cleans and formats price data.
*  **Machine Learning Models** 
    * ***Neural Network (Deep Learning)***
        * A deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict house prices.
        * Uses a Sequential model with dense and dropout layers.
        * Trains on standardized numerical and one-hot-encoded categorical data.
        * Evaluates model performance using R¬≤ score and MAE.
    * ***Linear Regression Model***
    
        * Uses sklearn.pipeline to preprocess data and train a linear regression model.
        * Evaluates feature importance to understand price determinants.
        * Computes RMSE and R¬≤ score for performance evaluation.
    * ***Random Forest Classifier***
        * Categorizes house prices into different price ranges.
        * Uses a RandomForestClassifier to classify properties into price bins.
        * Evaluates classification performance using confusion matrix and precision-recall scores.
        
* **Data Preprocessing** 
    * Converts categorical data (district, neighborhood) into numerical representations via one-hot encoding.
    * Standardizes numerical features (area, age, floor, etc.).
    * Bins price values into predefined categories for classification.
* **Feature Importance Analysis** 
    * Extracts and analyzes feature importance from the trained models.
    * Identifies which features contribute most to price determination.
* **New Data Prediction**  
    * Accepts new property details as input.
    * Predicts the estimated price or price category using trained models.
